---

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the script on your system:

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone the project from GitHub:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/thanks-terminal.git
cd thanks-terminal
```
### Step 2: Make the Script Executable
Change permissions to make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x thanks_script.sh
```
### Step 3: Move the Script to a Directory in Your PATH
To make the script globally accessible, move it to a directory that's part of your system's PATH:

```bash
sudo mv thanks_script.sh /usr/local/bin/thanks_script
```
### Step 4: (Optional) Add an Alias
For quicker access, you can add an alias to your shell configuration file:
Open your shell configuration file:
```bash
For Bash: nano ~/.bashrc
For Zsh: nano ~/.zshrc
```
Add the following line:
```bash
alias thanks="thanks_script thanks"
```
Save the file and reload your shell:
```bash

source ~/.bashrc   # For Bash
source ~/.zshrc    # For Zsh
```
Usage
Once installed, use the script by typing:

```bash
thanks
```
The terminal will respond with:

```bash
You're welcome, [your username]!
```
If you type anything other than thanks, the script will prompt you:

```bash
I only respond to gratitude. Try: thanks_script thanks
```
Example
Hereâ€™s what it looks like in action:

```bash
Copy code
$ thanks
You're welcome, Alice!
```
